# Final Capstone

This Directory contains the code for our Final Merit America Project. Our team of 5 built a Restaurant invite app that allows you to invite other users to an array of restaurants at a specific date and time, then the invited users can vote on which restaurant to eat at. This application is built with HTML,CSS, Javascript, React on the front end and Spring, Java, and SQL on the backend.
